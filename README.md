# Michigan State Fishing

Hello,

This repository contains the source for the official Michigan State Fishing Club website! I made this when I was first getting into webdev and I learned quite a bit from fiddling around with it!

## Technologies Used
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS framework used
- [Instagram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) - to get and embed images from our instagram page
- [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) - Just some regular client-side code to make API calls and generate containers in the DOM

## Link

## Coming Soon
- Site re-design with better web practices (probably still Bootstrap)
- Better client-side code that leverages ES6 niceties
- Site minification with webpack
